# Hi there 👋, here's InterLang Team 👨‍💻

You might notice the stop of Jython at 2.7, and Python 2.7 is the end of support, even though Jython 3 is in the plan, we all know that the fact that there isn't any progress in the main repo, and no ETAs.

Our team is full of passionate people that are doing their best at committing their part to Python's ecosystem.

InterPython is a project trying to make jvm-based Python, but more focused on connections.
