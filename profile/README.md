# Hi there 👋, here's Jython Continued Team 👨‍💻

You might notice the stop of Jython at 2.7, and Python 2.7 is the end of support, even though Jython 3 is in the plan, we all know that the fact that there isn't any progress in the main repo, and no ETAs.

Our team is full of passionate people that are doing their best at committing their part to Python's ecosystem.

The original team could be developing Jython 3, but this will still be valuable work to do.

You can check our repo for our progress, our plan is to go from 2.7 step by step to 3.10, 2.7 to 3.0, 3.0 to 3.1. This could be a completely different plan from the original team.

We are just started, please don't expect much in the repo.

Our work might be unwelcomed, if the original team is not suggesting us to do this we are fine to close this project.
